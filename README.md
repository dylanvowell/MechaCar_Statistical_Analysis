## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG of the values were the Intercept, Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance and maybe Weight since it was close to the 5% cutoff (7%). Overall, this data shows evidence of overfitting and cannot accuratly predict future data. 
- The slope is not considered to be 0 since there are factors that have significant impact to MPG, shown by their P values. 
- This linear model does not predict the MPG of the prototypes effectively since the intercept is showing signs of overfitting and therefore cannot accurately predict future values. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- While the total PSI variance across all lots is less than the threshhold(top image), Lot 3 does not meet the individual standards. Shown below, the vairance of Lot 3 individually is ~170 PSI - well over the 100 PSI threshhold, (bottom image).
